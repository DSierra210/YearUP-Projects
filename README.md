# YearUP-Projects
 Projects created during my time at YearUP

## Projects created in Netlify Websites:

### Tribute Page Project: 
---
In this project, we were to create a tribute page about someone who has made
a major contribution in the field of Technology.<br/>
My choice was the creator of the worlde wide web.

### YearUp Landing Page Project:
---
This project had our class create a landing page that promotes YearUp to 
perspective participants. <br/>
As there is already a landing page for YearUp I decided to use its original style
as a mock-up for practice.

### Contact Form Project:
---
A simple project having our class creat a contact form.<br/>
I chose to use this opportunity to mess around with some styles I never tried before, such as 
radial-gradient and manipulating the radio buttons to look like actual buttons.

### Restaurant Website Project:
---
The restaurant project was a 3-page website where we either referenced an existing restaurant or create a fictional one.<br/>
I opted to create a fictional italian restaurant called Gustatus. I practiced a little of DOM 
manipulation during the menu page and made adjustments to how the date type input functions in the reserve webpage.
